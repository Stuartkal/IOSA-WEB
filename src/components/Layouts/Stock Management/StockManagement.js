                        <p>
                        Several weaners intended for the market or for other purposes can be sexed and reared together in one large cage. 
                        The construction of a cage suitable for weaners. To prevent weaners from fighting each other, 
                        it is important that those placed in the same cage are the same age. When they are three or three and a half months old, 
                        they must be separated and each one placed in its own cage. If this is not done, does will begin to ride one another, causing ‘false pregnancies’. 
                        The bucks will begin to castrate one another, which will lead to fighting and the possible death of some of the rabbits. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>2. Breeding management </h3>
                        <p>
                        For efficient production, the rabbit breeder should plan the mating program of the rabbits so that three or more does give birth within a day or so of each other. 
                        This arrangement is known as ‘synchronization’. One of the advantages of synchronization is that it enables the owner to provide adequate care for his or her rabbits. 
                        For example, if a doe with only eight teats produces an unusually large litter of, say, ten rabbits she will have more than she can nurse. 
                        To reduce the numbers she has to nurse, two or three young rabbits can be transferred to a doe who has just produced a smaller than usual litter. 
                        If a doe produces an exceptionally small litter, the whole litter can be given to other does to nurse so that she is then ready for immediate impregnation or breeding. 
                        In such instances, it is advisable to allow this doe to be mated without delay. Extra young rabbits are readily accepted by foster mothers if they are of the same age, within two or three days, 
                        as their own litter. Rabbit breeders should manage such situations to their advantage. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>2.1 Controlled mating</h3>
                        <p>
                        A good buck has the stamina to cover a female 10 to 12 times a day. Indeed, if a doe is left with a buck overnight it is likely that the buck will tire himself out in repeated and useless attempts to mate her. 
                        A buck should not be allowed to strain himself in this way. The ideal course is to allow the buck only one mating chance per doe. After a doe is serviced for the first time, she should be removed from the buck’s cage and, 
                        shortly afterwards, another doe should be placed in the cage. In this way, a buck can service three to five does in one day, with no harm to himself. If he is then allowed to rest for a few days, he can service another three or four does. 
                        In theory, controlled mating would allow a buck to mate with any number of does. However, the conscientious rabbit breeder would never repeatedly cross all his does with the same buck for fear of inbreeding (breeding between animals which are closely related). 
                        Inbred rabbits are usually smaller and weaker than normal rabbits; any such inferior rabbits should be culled. Does are ready for impregnation when they are more than five months old. If they are more than three years old they usually give birth to smaller litters. 
                        Any doe consistently producing less than eight in a litter should be eliminated.
                        Depending on the number of does which are present in a rabbit farm, two or more bucks are usually required for breeding purposes. If, however, the rabbit fanner does not want to maintain his own bucks, he can manage to have his does serviced by the bucks from another farm. 
                        When raising rabbits, it is important to select only the best animals for breeding stock and to keep accurate records of their servicing and kindling.
                        </p>
                        <h3>2.2 The heat period</h3>
                        <p>
                        Does are impregnated during their heat period. This lasts for 15 to 16 days. When a doe is on heat, she becomes restless and aggressive. Her genital area becomes swollen, pinkish red and moist and she begins to jump about, always trying to get into the cage of the rabbit next to her. 
                        As soon as a doe is seen to be on heat, she must be serviced. If two does are in the same cage, the doe on heat will attempt to ride the other doe. If the rabbit farmer ignores this behavior, it can lead to a ‘false pregnancy’. 
                        This term is used when a doe thinks she is about to give birth and prepares a kindling box by collecting rubbish and pulling out her fur to line the box. Does exhibiting this behavior should be serviced immediately, just as does which are seen to be on heat must be serviced immediately to avoid developing a false pregnancy. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>2.3 After delivery</h3>
                        <p>
                        After the doe has given birth to the litter, it is necessary to check several aspects. <br/><br/>
                        <strong>•</strong> All the newly born rabbits are in the kindling box. If they are scattered about in the cage, collect them for safekeeping in the box. <br/><br/>
                        <strong>•</strong>The size of each of the young is normal. If any are abnormally small, remove and destroy them. If they are allowed to remain, they will die later.    This could happen at any time between the 2nd and 60th day, during which time the rabbit will have wasted precious milk and food supplies.<br/><br/>
                        <strong>•</strong>The newly born have taken some milk by looking at the size of their bellies. If none has taken any milk, this shows there is something wrong with the mother and her young will die of starvation. Remove them from the hutch and place them with healthy does.<br/><br/>
                        <strong>•</strong> She does not have too many young to care for. If she has, the extra ones should be given to a doe able to care for more rabbits. <br/><br/>
                        <strong>•</strong>They are all still alive. This must be done every morning. Note that if the newly born rabbits need to be given to another doe, this doe must have given birth at almost the same time as the original doe.<br/><br/>
                        </p>
                        <h3>2.4 Death in the litter</h3>
                        <p>
                        Chilling because of lack of care by the mother or the rabbit farmer may lead to the death of young rabbits. If textile materials are placed in the kindling box, the threads can entangle and deform or kill a young rabbit. 
                        Rabbits should be kept out of the rain completely. Strong young rabbits will generate heat for themselves when the weather is cold by forming a cluster. A sick young rabbit is usually isolated. 
                        When it dies the mother will bury it in the kindling bed. It is important to inspect the bed every day to ensure that any dead rabbits are removed immediately so that the decomposition does not affect the others.
                         Many factors cause high infant mortality rates. <br/><br/>

                        <h3>Feeding rabbits</h3>
                        <p>
                        Rabbits will never eat anything dirty. Care must therefore be taken when gathering plants. During the wet season, it is advisable that rabbit farmers dry the plants for several hours before they feed the rabbits. 
                        In the dry season, however, there is no need to do this and the plants can be fed to them straight away.
                        </p>
                        <h3>3.1 plants to avoid</h3>
                        <p><strong>3.1. A Succulents</strong> (mainly grow around swampy areas) </p>
                        <p>
                        Leaves or greens which contain large quantities of water are termed succulents. Young rabbits, pregnant and nursing does should not be fed such plants unless a careful study of the effects of the plants has been made.
                        After eating certain succulents, rabbits are liable to develop diarrhea and young rabbits, especially weaners, will soon die.
                        Pregnant does are liable to have miscarriages. These rabbits should therefore be fed on dry leaves.
                        </p>
                        <h3>3.1. B Sweet potato</h3>
                        <p>
                        Many rabbit supply their rabbits with the leaves of sweet potato, but this can be disastrous. Rabbits fed on immature sweet potato leaves usually do not produce well. Often, 
                        the females cannot have offspring and the few young that are born are subject to a high mortality rate. As with cabbage, 
                        sweet potato leaves can safely be fed to rabbits when the plant is mature but it is difficult to determine when it has reached maturity. 
                        Because of the adverse effects which result from eating immature leaves, this plant should not be included on the list of recommended foods.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>3.1. C Talinum trangulare</strong>  (example of purslane) </p>
                        <p>
                        This is a good succulent plant for chickens. Although it is not popular with rabbits, it is believed that when rabbits are fed on it for an extended period, they sometimes develop a taste for it. 
                        Before feeding it to rabbits, the abundant juice in the plant should be reduced by spreading it to dry in the sun for a few hours. It should be fed to adult rabbits only.
                        </p>
                        <h3>3.1. D Butterfly larvae </h3>
                        <p>
                        The cocoons or larvae of many species of butterflies and moths can be dangerous to rabbits. When greens are gathered, any leaves which bear these should be discarded. Normally, when rabbits are eating,
                        they smell the foreign body and avoid eating that particular part of the leaf. Occasionally, however, they fail to detect the presence of foreign matter. 
                        Cocoons or larvae can be eliminated from leaves in the hutch by sprinkling water containing salt on the leaves.  
                        </p>
                        <h3>3.2 What to feed rabbits</h3>
                        <h3>3.2. A Planting fodder</h3>
                        <p>
                        For farmers operating large-scale enterprises, collecting green grass and creeping plants from the wild for large-scale rabbit farming is tedious work. 
                        It often involves covering considerable distances before enough suitable edible material is found. In addition, greens collected in this manner are easily soiled in the process. 
                        One way of overcoming the problem is for the farmer to grow suitable plants which are easy to harvest. 
                        Some leguminous shrubs and trees are excellent for rabbit feed although planting fodder on a large scale to feed domestic animals is not a traditional practice in much of Africa, there is no reason why it should not be adopted. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>3.2. B Caloponium mucunoides</h3>
                        <p>
                        This plant is regarded as one of the best rabbit foods. It is a creeper and looks like Centrosema pubescens. The main feature which distinguishes the two plants is that C. 
                        mucunoides has a hairy stalk whereas the stalk of C. pubescens lacks hair. Cmucunoidesis propagated from seed and will grow prolifically if it is properly managed.
                        </p>
                        <h3>3.2. C Carbohydrates</h3>
                        <p>
                        Carbohydrates are energy-giving foods and are an essential component of a balanced diet. The dried pulp of sugar cane, 
                        if ground and mixed with grains and dried leaves and then formed into pellets, is a useful feed. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>3.2. D Grains </h3>
                        <p>
                        Rabbits enjoy all grain foods. The part of the grain which should be given to them is the husk (the outer covering of rice, maize, millet, etc). 
                        The spent grain from brewers’ malt is also good food. It is worth visiting a local brewery, collecting the spent grain and drying it. 
                        It is high in nutrients for rabbits. Maize and rice husks can be collected, sometimes free of charge, from mills. 
                        Always keep grain products in feeding troughs which are designed in such a way as to prevent rabbits from scattering their droppings into them.
                        </p>
                        <h3>3.2. E Water</h3>
                        <p>
                        A reliable supply of clean water is essential. A restricted supply of water will inhibit food intake, restrict growth and reduce the supply of milk. 
                        Fresh leaves contain some water but not enough to meet the rabbit’s needs. If rabbits consume large quantities of dried foods, 
                        an abundant supply of water will be required. A doe about to give birth must have large quantities of good drinking water. 
                        After delivery, she will drink large quantities to fill her stomach. In the absence of automatic watering devices, the rabbit farmer must provide a suitable heavy bowl inside the cage.
                        </p>
                        <h3>4. Feeding methods</h3>
                        <p>
                        Fresh leaves and any other type of food scattered in the rabbit cages will be turned into bedding material and also into a place for fouling. 
                        The farmer will think there is enough food in the cage for the animal but rabbits will not eat soiled food. Green leaves should always be suspended off the ground in a hanging position. 
                        Rabbits will also reject greens which have been collected from the roadside, especially those which smell smoky or oily from motor vehicle engines. Always ensure that greens are collected from clean places.
                        Farmers should make sure there is always enough food in the cage, remembering that rabbits need food during the night. Grains must be placed in a trough or a heavy bowl which the rabbits cannot tip over.
                        </p>
                        <h3>5. Selecting breeding stock </h3>
                        <p>
                        Breeding stock must be selected from among the best that is available to ensure that only desirable traits are passed on to the offspring. 
                        There are several qualities to look for in breeding stock. <br/>
                        <strong style={{fontSize:'25px'}}>•</strong> The animals must be prolific breeders. <br/><br/>
                        <strong style={{fontSize:'25px'}}>•</strong> They should have a good growth rate.  <br/><br/>
                        <strong style={{fontSize:'25px'}}>•</strong>They must be good converters of food.  <br/><br/>
                        <strong style={{fontSize:'25px'}}>•</strong> They should have a high meat to bone ratio. Small, 
                        lean and unhealthy rabbits as well as old, sterile, castrated and deformed animals must be disposed of. 
                        They can be used as a source of meat and but should not be used for breeding purposes. <br/><br/>
                        </p>
                        <h3>5.1 Selecting a good doe</h3>
                        <p>
                        A doe which is to be used for breeding purposes should have reached adulthood (five months old or more but not more than 18 months). 
                        She should have at least eight teats, all visible and normal.
                        </p>
                        <h3>5.2 Selecting a good buck </h3>
                        <p>
                        It is the buck who largely determines the quality of the breeding operation. His size and most of his other features will be inherited by his offspring. 
                        His influence is therefore usually much greater than that of the female. Care must therefore be taken to select only the best specimens. 
                        The buck should be well built and have a round head, sound feet, a broad and meaty body and a good undercoat of fur. He should have short claws. 
                        The testicles must be visible and well developed. There should be no bite marks. If young bucks of about 14 weeks old are left together in one cage they usually fight and try to castrate one another. 
                        The buck must show no sign of discharge from its nose or other symptoms of disease.
                        </p>
                        <h3>5.3 Inbreeding </h3>
                        <p>
                        The main reason why many animal breeders, including rabbit farmers, have remained small-scale operators is that the death toll of their animals is high. Often, no cause can be found. 
                        Farmers who have experienced this problem should check the degree of inbreeding that has taken place. It is a common practice to keep male offspring in the same barn. 
                        It is a common sight, for example, to see a young goat having sex with his mother or sisters. If this goat matures in the place where he was born, he will continue to cover his relatives. 
                        A farm where this is allowed to happen is doomed because the offspring will become weaker and weaker and the infant mortality rate greater and greater.
                        </p>
                        <h3>6. Record keeping</h3>
                        <p>
                        Record keeping is an essential part of the breeding operation. A family history and breeding record must be kept for every breeding doe and buck. 
                        The seller must be ready to provide accurate information about every animal, young or old, whenever a buyer requests it.
                        </p>
                        <h3>7. Disease and pests</h3>
                        <p>
                        Nature has endowed most animals with the instinct to eat certain leaves which have curative properties. 
                        Some of the illnesses which afflict them can be cured if they eat the appropriate leaves. 
                        If the animals are allowed to move about freely they can cure themselves. Rabbits kept in hutches, however, are unable to do this. It is essential, therefore, 
                        that the breeder provides a variety of leaves for the rabbits so that a sick rabbit might, by chance, eat the particular leaf required to cure itself. 
                        Rabbits that die from an unknown cause should be removed and burnt, and the cages they occupied should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected.
